PREAMBLE = """
You find yourself at a blackjack table. The dealer yells at you:

"Hey! You look like a rube! Prove your worth, you plebian."

"Huh", you think. But it's too late. Thousands of ghost tendrils
are pulling you in closer to the table. You are certainly going to
play a game of Blackjack. 

Like it not, that's what's in store for you today.

"""

TABLE_INTRO = """

"Ahh! Stranger! I see you're all hot and bothered to play a nice game of
Blackjack. Sweet! I love that game."

"Alright, I will now construct a deck of cards!"

"""

HAND_INTRO = """

"Nice! This deck of cards is flippin' sweet. So rad. Check it out."

"Alright, alright. Calm down. Here, you can have a \"Hand\" of cards as well."

"""

GAME_INTRO = """

Okay awesome! Now you have a hand of cards. I can't see them, only you can.

"""

EPILOGUE = """
Well, we've all had some fun. You laughed, you cried. Remember 
when the blackjack dealer tried to trick you into buying him a
drink? That was pretty funny. 

I hope you enjoyed this experience. I'm sure you've learned a lot from it.

Cheers,
C
